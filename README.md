# LaundryBot
A bot that tweets laundry information for Winthrop University using the LaundryView 
API. It's basically irrelevant because there is a website that has all of this 
information. I just wanted to do a project and this is it. I keep finding little things that I can fix so this is definitely a WIP :)
