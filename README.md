# LaundryBot
A bot that tweets laundry information for Winthrop University using the LaundryView 
API. It's basically irrelevant because there is a website that has all of this 
information. I just wanted to do a project and this is it. I'm still waiting on twitter 
to get back to me about API access (could take more than a week, so no tweets yet).
